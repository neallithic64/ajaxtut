# Applying AJAX in Node.js
### Client-Side Validation in Your Web Application

You'll see that there're two files in this folder. The file `login.html` has some AJAX script embedded into it. On the other hand, there's the `controller.js` file that holds the backend logic used to process requests from the frontend.

Note that these files do *not* work at all. The code within them merely contain the sample logic used to create AJAX processes in them.

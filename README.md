# READ ME I GUESS
### Very very small AJAX tutorial

Download all of the files or clone this repo and run the `ajaxy.html` file. Open `ajax.js` to follow along with the tutorial. Note that `data.json` is not used at all in the "application" since we can't do GET HTTP requests from a local file. The file's there for reference.

Of course, Sir Arren already made a tutorial for AJAX. You can find it [here](https://github.com/arvention/ccapdev-ajax). However, I thought of making a short and simple one as a primer so that you become familiar with the format.  
Anyway, you don't have to check this if you don't have the time, but yeah. Cool.
